# hello-world
This is my first repository

I've been programming since the mid eighties.  First in the various dBase clones, later in the various incarnations of C.

Until recently, all my experience has been with desktop applications.  They will always be what I am most comfortable with, but I can no longer expect to be able to continue working largely within the desktop environment.
